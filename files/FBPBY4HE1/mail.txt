Hi Bram,

I said +packages is not necessary in tiny build,
but some repositories work without +eval (e.g. which only contains help files, https://github.com/vim-jp/vimdoc-ja).
They may have benefits if +packages feature is enabled at tiny build.

But I don't know if tiny vim needs +packages feature...
Because it should run on restricted machines...

By the way, +packages seems to require +eval because below lines

#ifndef FEAT_EVAL
# define ex_packadd        ex_ni
# define ex_packloadall        ex_ni
#endif

So "+packages" on :version command output should be "-packages" when -eval.
Attached patch fixes it.
