		If select a raster font (Courier, Terminal or FixedSys) to
		'guifont', it falls back to be drawn by GDI automatically.
		This fallback will cause significant slow down on drawing.

		NOTE: It is known that some fonts and options combination
		causes trouble on drawing glyphs.

		  - 'rendmode:5' and 'renmode:6' will not work with some
		    bitmap fonts.
		  - 'taamode:3' will not work with some vector fonts.

		NOTE: With this option, you can display colored emoji
		(emoticon) in Windows 8.1 or later.  To display colored emoji,
		there are some conditions which you should notice.

		  - If your font includes non-colored emoji already, it will
		    be used.
		  - If your font doesn't have emoji, the system chooses an
		    alternative symbol font.  On Windows 10, "Segoe UI Emoji"
		    will be used.
		  - When this alternative font didn't have fixed width glyph,
		    emoji might be rendered beyond the bounding box of drawing
		    cell.
