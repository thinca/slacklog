This patch introduces two big features and one small fix to Vim's
DirectX rendering.

1.  Support colored emoji (emoticon).
2.  Improve drawing speed extremely.
3.  'taamode' option didn't work.

Emoji was started from Japan and now widely used in the World as you
know.  It has became very important parts for the communication.  Recent
Windows supports colored emoji with DirectX, but Vim couldn't use it.
This patch implements colored emoji for Vim.

Vim's DirectX support was not enough about drawing speed.  It was caused
by wrong use of DirectX.  Now Vim's DirectX rendering is equal or faster
than GDI.

The 'taamode' option didn't work entirely because of incorrect use of
DirectX.  This patch fixes it.

And last, this patch is written by collaborating mattn, k-takata and me.
Please enjoy colored üç£ emoji with this patch. üòÑ
