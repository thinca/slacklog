- Table, procedure and view dictionaries include the owner name of the
   object.  This is on by default, but can be controlled via a new global
   option, dbext_default_dict_show_owner.  This has not been enabled for all
   databases it depends on whether the database supports this feature.  The
   autoload\sqlcomplete.vim plugin takes advantage of this feature.
