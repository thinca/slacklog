Note that I&rsquo;m also a part of its organization, but the rule there is that you don&rsquo;t review your own submission. Mine got accepted eventually by them &#128512;\n&nbsp;\nThis was my shortest CFP submission. Mainly because this was a very short talk (I selected the shortest timeslot), and also I had submitted one at VimConf 2018 last year too. Usually my CFP submissions are 2 or 3 times larger than this one.\nTitle\n13 Vim plugins I use every day\nAbstract\n\n  Please describe about your talk in English to the VimConf audience\n\nI&rsquo;m going to talk about how I use these plugins to be able to write code effectively as a professional programmer.\nquickrun\nvimshell\nunite (+neomru)\ndeoplete (+neosnippet)\ntabpagebuffer/tabpagecd\nlexima\nopen-browser\nfontzoom\ngina\nnclipper\nsurround\ncaw\ncursorword\nPitch for reviewers (NOT to be displayed)\n\n  Please promote yourself and your talk for us.

That&rsquo;s fine as described above.\nNote that I&rsquo;m enjoying a glass of wine and totally drunken\n&nbsp;\nPresentation duration\n\n\n&gt; Select your configurable presentation time.
