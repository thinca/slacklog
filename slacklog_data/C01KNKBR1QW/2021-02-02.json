It snowed until about 8am, which was great, but it rained after that, and the rain over the fresh snow really made the snow layer heavy. Upper part of the Cut was so slow and sticky, and due to rain, fog, and wind, it was hard to read the terrain, therefore it was hard to run anywhere. The lower part was better. Upper buckhorn was really windy. Skyline was fine, since it was pressed and also probably trees prevented the fog and wind. The runs weren\u0026rsquo;t icy, so it was safe, and the lifts had no lines, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t worst, but unlike ice there\u0026rsquo;s no way to get the conditions better during a day, which made us sad. We\u0026rsquo;re looking forward to hitting cold air to the mountains!\n\n\n\nOverall rate: 2/5 \u0026#9733;\u0026#9733;\u0026#9734;\u0026#9734;\u0026#9734;\n\n\n\nClosed run:\n\n\n\nCoffin (Black)Closed chairlifts:\n\n\n\nPeak ChairOpen terrain parks:\n\n\n\nParadise Jib ParkGrouse Park (Side Cut)Cut Park was removed.
