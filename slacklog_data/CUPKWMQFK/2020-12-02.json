Future work: classes                                 *vim9-classes*\n \nAbove \"class\" was mentioned a few times, but it has not been implemented yet.\nMost of Vim9 script can be created without this functionality, and since\nimplementing classes is going to be a lot of work, it is left for the future.\nFor now we'll just make sure classes can be added later.\n \nThoughts:\n- `class` / `endclass`, everything in one file\n- Class names are always CamelCase\n- Single constructor\n- Single inheritance with `class ThisClass extends BaseClass`\n- `abstract class`\n- `interface` (Abstract class without any implementation)\n- `class SomeClass implements SomeInterface`\n- Generics for class: `class \u0026lt;Tkey, Tentry\u0026gt;`\n- Generics for function: `def \u0026lt;Tkey\u0026gt; GetLast(key: Tkey)`\n \nAgain, much of this is from TypeScript.\n \nSome things that look like good additions:\n- Use a class as an interface (like Dart)\n- Extend a class with methods, using an import (like Dart)\n \nAn important class that will be provided is \"Promise\".  Since Vim is single\nthreaded, connecting asynchronous operations is a natural way of allowing\nplugins to do their work without blocking the user.  It's a uniform way to\ninvoke callbacks and handle timeouts and errors.\n```","ts":"1606888398.395000","bot_id":"BPM858KEE","team":"T03C4RC8V","replace_original":false,"delete_original":false,"blocks":null},{"client_msg_id":"45d8d0a9-adeb-49ba-b250-818e1b451b8c","type":"message","user":"U7HFY4HFY","text":":h vim9-classes","ts":"1606888397.394900","team":"T03C4RC8V","replace_original":false,"delete_original":false,"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"8gVQ"}]},{"client_msg_id":"4438ea68-0ee0-4775-a6ae-31d663a45d2f","type":"message","user":"U7HFY4HFY","text":"ざんねんながら……\nゆくゆくはクラスを導入するつもりらしいのでそれまでおあずけ","ts":"1606888348.394700","team":"T03C4RC8V","replace_original":false,"delete_original":false,"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"DJf48"}]},{"client_msg_id":"b373de86-4fe4-481e-b17f-ff0faa0f0136","type":"message","user":"U03C71D7H","text":"あれ、 Vim9script って辞書関数定義できないの…?","ts":"1606887696.393400","team":"T03C4RC8V","replace_original":false,"delete_original":false,"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"HDew"}]}]
