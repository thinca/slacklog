Where you might use \":...\u0026lt;CR\u0026gt;\" in the\n{rhs} of a mapping, you can instead use \"\u0026lt;Cmd\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;CR\u0026gt;\".\nExample:  \n        noremap x \u0026lt;Cmd\u0026gt;echo mode(1)\u0026lt;CR\u0026gt;\n \nThis is more flexible than `:\u0026lt;C-U\u0026gt;` in Visual and Operator-pending mode, or\n`\u0026lt;C-O\u0026gt;:` in Insert mode, because the commands are executed directly in the\ncurrent mode, instead of always going to Normal mode.  Visual mode is\npreserved, so tricks with |gv| are not needed.  Commands can be invoked\ndirectly in Command-line mode (which would otherwise require timer hacks).\nExample of using \u0026lt;Cmd\u0026gt; halfway Insert mode:  \n        nnoremap \u0026lt;F3\u0026gt; aText \u0026lt;Cmd\u0026gt;echo mode(1)\u0026lt;CR\u0026gt; Added\u0026lt;Esc\u0026gt;\n \nUnlike \u0026lt;expr\u0026gt; mappings, there are no special restrictions on the \u0026lt;Cmd\u0026gt;\ncommand: it is executed as if an (unrestricted) |autocommand| was invoked.\n \nNote:\n- Because \u0026lt;Cmd\u0026gt; avoids mode-changes it does not trigger |CmdlineEnter| and\n  |CmdlineLeave| events, because no user interaction is expected.\n- For the same reason, |keycodes| like \u0026lt;C-R\u0026gt;\u0026lt;C-W\u0026gt; are interpreted as plain,\n  unmapped keys.\n- The command is not echo'ed, no need for \u0026lt;silent\u0026gt;.\n- In Visual mode  you can use `line('v')` and `col('v')` to get one end of the\n  Visual area, the cursor is at the other end.\n- In Select mode, |:map| and |:vmap| command mappings are executed in\n  Visual mode.  Use |:smap| to handle Select mode differently.\n```","ts":"1611139632.018100","bot_id":"BPM858KEE","team":"T03C4RC8V","replace_original":false,"delete_original":false,"blocks":null},{"client_msg_id":"fae01f18-1350-4dce-90bf-c4832197961d","type":"message","user":"UGXMRNBUM","text":":h \u0026lt;cmd\u0026gt;","ts":"1611139631.018000","team":"T03C4RC8V","replace_original":false,"delete_original":false,"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"38a"}]}]
